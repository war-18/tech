            Let's build the bridge model using popsicles and glue. As bridges have a special place in transportation infrastructure due their direct relationship with other places. Participating in the Bridge Building Competition students get a flavor of what it is to be an Engineer, designing structures to a set of specifications and then seeing them perform their function. They are also provided with an academically-oriented extracurricular activity that is recognized school-wide.

            <li>
            Materials: Each team is given a set of materials to build their bridge. The materials can include items like popsicle sticks, glue.</li>
            <li>
            Design Phase: Participants are given a set amount of time to plan and design their bridge.</li>
            <li>
            Building Phase: Once the design phase is over, participants are given a set amount of time to build their bridge using the materials they were given.</li>
            <li>
            Testing Phase: After the building phase, each bridge is tested for its strength and durability. The testing phase can involve placing weights on the bridge to see how much it can hold or subjecting the bridge to other types of stress tests.
            </li>
            <li>
            Judging: Finally, a panel of judges evaluates each bridge based on criteria such as its strength, durability, creativity, and overall appearance. The team with the highest score is declared the winner.
